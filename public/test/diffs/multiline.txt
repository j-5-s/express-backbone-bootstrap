-<div><span class="blackBText">General Terms:</span> If you agree to maintain service for a minimum Term, the Term begins when you accept the Subscriber Agreement (e.g., signature, activate service, use phone, etc.). You may terminate any line of service before its Term ends by calling us, however you will be responsible for an EARLY TERMINATION FEE of up to $350/line for Advanced Devices &amp; up to $200 ETF/line for other devices for each line/number terminated early - except for terminations consistent with our return policy.  The ETF is prorated and is calculated by taking the months remaining on your Agreement times $20 for Advanced Devices, with a maximum of $350, and minimum of $100.  For all other devices, the prorated ETF is calculated by taking the months remaining times $10 with a maximum of $200 and minimum of $50. Payment of the ETF does not satisfy other obligations owed to us, including Term commitments with other lines or service/equipment charges. We reserve the right to cancel offers early or extend offers without notice. Offers are subject to credit approval. An account spending limit may apply - ask for specific amount. Spending limit accounts are subject to a fee of $4.99/mo. per account. The fee will be waived for accounts enrolled recurring automatic payments. In certain areas, a $4.99 per month account spending limit fee will apply per line. Monthly service plan charges accrue even if your service is turned off for exceeding your spending limit or non-payment. If payment is not received in full by the due date on your bill, late fees may be assessed, in amounts up to the maximum amount permitted by law in the state of your billing address. Offers may not be available everywhere, combinable with other promotions/options, or available to business customers. Coverage is not available everywhere and varies by service - see mapping brochures or visit www.sprint.com/coverage for details. Monthly charges exclude taxes, Sprint Surcharges [incl. USF charge (varies quarterly), cost recovery and administrative fees, & state/local fees by area (e.g., in some areas up to 16% but in most areas less than 3%)]. Sprint Surcharges are not taxes or gov't-required charges and are subject to change. Up to a $36 phone activation fee applies to new activations, certain service plan changes or upgrades of phones or devices ("phones"). A $36 reconnect fee may apply to reestablish service on all accounts that have been disconnected for nonpayment. A deposit, in most instances between $50 and $750 (but sometimes up to $1000), may be required per line to establish service. Our services will only work with our phones -  not all services are available with all phones or on all networks. Monthly service charges are not refunded or prorated if service is terminated or modified before your billing cycle ends. All phone usage, including incoming/outgoing calls, incurs charges unless specified otherwise. Except where specified, included plan minutes are not good for off-network roaming calls. International roaming rates for voice and data services are additional and will vary. On calls that cross time periods, minutes are generally deducted or charged based on the call start time. Unused monthly plan minutes do not carry forward. Partial minutes of use are rounded up to the next whole minute.</div>

+<div><span class="blackBText">New Agreements on the Nextel&reg; National Network:</span> Your service on a device activated on the Nextel National Network requires a new two-year Agreement per line. Sprint expressly reserves the right to migrate your service during the Agreement term from the Nextel National Network to the Nationwide Sprint Network to complete your Agreement term. Reasonable advance notice of the service change will be provided and customers can then either (a) choose to complete the Agreement term by transitioning to the Nationwide Sprint Network with no additional term commitment required (Transition Option), or (b) deactivate service. Deactivations because of this service change will not result in an Early Termination Fee (ETF). Transition Option: If you select the Transition Option, you will receive a free basic Sprint Direct Connect push-to-talk device and can maintain your existing service plan, if available. During the Agreement term, Sprint may provide other offers that are separate from the Transition Option, and these offers will be subject to a new two-year Agreement per line.</div>

Other inbound calls will be allowed for this time period.  In the event a 911 call is dropped or disconnected, public safety may not be able to place a call-back to the customer. Removing in-bound call blocking requires processing time.  Sprint will make a good faith effort to complete the removal of inbound blocking, and will cooperate with public safety to remove inbound call blocking upon request.  Call blocking will be restored after the 24-hour period. The customer will not be notified when the block is removed nor reinstated as a result of a call to 911.
